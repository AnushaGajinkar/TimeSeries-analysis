In the excel file TimeSeries for volatile data: We have modeled Moving average, Exponential smooting moving average and GARCH model using solver. We understand that if the time seriies data is volatile we should model the varaince into it. Moving avearge method can be helpful if we just want to take an idea of next day return. However, forecasting using data for a perticular window may not be good enough so we try the EWMA method giving some weight to previous return and the lagged varaince. In Garch model along with the lagged variance and the previous error term we inculde mean reversion factor while modeling the variance. We have used solver to estimate the parameter. The source to understand how to do is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0Cw3gwBhjo.

The python code GARCH model is same as given at https://pyflux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/garch.html. I tried to check how it works. However, I have not used pyflux instad used arch_model() function. I have observed that in solver the estimated parameter is based on how we initialize it. The results differ for different seed value. So it is better to perforn the Garch model in advance software like python, which will not have this issue.
